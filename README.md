# link-select
Small application to get used to Go (http://golang.org/) - so don't blame me for mistakes as this is my first time using Go in practice.

# Description
Small command-line tool to select links by some criterion, e.g. randomly. Links are provided through JSON files.  

A more detailed description will follow.
